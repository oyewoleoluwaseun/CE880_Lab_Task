UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This appeal is against the decision of the High Court of Yobe State, Coram Judice: Amina Shehu, J., delivered on 30th March 2022 in CHARGE NO. YBS/PT/HC/NNR/01C/2021: THE STATE vs. MUHAMMADU USMAN A.K.A. ALHAJIYEL. The Appellant, who was the accused person at the lower Court, was arraigned on a one count charge of culpable homicide punishable with death. At the end of the trial, the lower Court held that the charge had been proved beyond reasonable doubt, it convicted the Appellant as charged and in imposing sentence held that it would be lenient and consequently sentenced the Appellant to twenty (20) years imprisonment. By law, the punishment upon conviction for the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death is the mandatory death sentence. The lower Court imposed a punishment of custodial sentence for a term of twenty (20) years. However, no issue has been made of the sentence imposed in this appeal, so I will let that sleeping dog continue with its peaceful slumber.

​The background facts of the case as garnered from the cold printed Records disclose that the case is grounded


1

in the belief in witchcraft. A relation of the Appellant had taken ill, and it was said that the illness was caused by the deceased who had bewitched her and cast a spell on her. The Appellant among others tried to get the deceased to “cross” their sick relative with both legs so that the spell would be removed. The deceased refused. The deceased was later killed in her farm and the Appellant was charged to Court for her murder. In proof of its case, the Prosecution called two witnesses, including the PW2, who gave an eyewitness account of the killing of the deceased. The Appellant in defence testified for himself and called two other witnesses, whose testimony raised the defence of alibi.
​
The Appellant, dissatisfied with the decision of the lower Court appealed against the same by Notice of Appeal filed on 28th June 2022. The judgment of the lower Court is at pages 64-72 of the Records of Appeal, while the Notice of Appeal is at pages 73-78 of the Records of Appeal. In prosecution of the appeal, the Records of Appeal was compiled and transmitted, and briefs of argument filed and exchanged. The said briefs were adopted and relied upon by



2

learned counsel at the hearing of the appeal.

In the Appellant’s Brief which was filed on 27th September 2022, but deemed as properly filed on 31st January 2024, two issues were distilled for determination as follows:
“1. Whether from the circumstances of this case, the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant in spite of the obvious and material contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. (Distilled from grounds 1 and 2).
2. Whether or not the appellant was entitled to benefit from the defence of Alibi considering the fact that it was raised at the earliest opportunity and the respondent has not placed anything before the Court to debunk same. (Distilled from ground 3)”.

The Respondent adopted the two issues formulated by the Appellant in the Respondent’s Brief filed on 11th March 2024 but deemed as properly filed on 13th March 2024.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT’S COUNSEL
The Appellant submits that the Prosecution has the duty to prove all the essential elements of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. The cases of ADIO vs. THE STATE (1986) 4 SC



3

194 at 219-220 and EMEKA vs. THE STATE (2001) 14 NWLR (PT 734) 666 at 669 ratio 1 were referred to. The ingredients of the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death were set out and it was stated that all the ingredients must be proved failing which the result will be an acquittal vide ESEYIN vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR-26015 (CA), MAIGARI vs. THE STATE (2010) LPELR-4457 (CA), R vs. OLEDINMA (1940) 6 WACA 202, UYO vs. A-G BENDEL STATE (1986) 1 NWLR (PT 17) 418 at 426 and GABRIEL vs. THE STATE (1989) 5 NWLR (PT 122) 457.

It was contended that the evidence of the PW2 which the lower Court relied upon to convict was laden with contradictions and did not establish that it was the act of the Appellant that caused the death of the deceased. The case of BANDE vs. THE STATE (1972) 10 SC 79 was relied upon. It was posited that the contradiction in the testimony was such that the charge could not be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, since the doubts arising from the contradictions ought to have been resolved in favour of the Appellant. The cases of KUMBUL vs. THE STATE (1973) NMLR 132, KWAGHSHIR vs. THE STATE (1995) 3 NWLR (PT 386) 651,



4

OGUNLANA vs. THE STATE (1995) 5 NWLR (PT 395) 266, NWABUEZE vs. THE STATE (1988) 3 NWLR (PT 86) 16 and DOGO vs. THE STATE (2001) 83 LRCN 179 were cited in support.

Referring to the cases of AKPA vs. THE STATE (2007) 2 NWLR (PT 1019) [no page stated] and EKE vs. THE STATE (2011) 1-2 SC (PT II) 219 on the distinction between discrepancy and a contradiction in testimony, it was asserted that the contradiction in the testimony of the PW2 was material and fundamental such that the offence cannot be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The cases of ADONIKE vs. THE STATE (2015) 1 SCNJ 146, ONUBOGU vs. THE STATE (1974) LPELR-SC. 180/1974 and AGBO vs. THE STATE (2007) 2 NCC at 158-163 ratio 11 were called in aid.

The Appellant’s argument on the second issue is that when the defence of alibi is promptly and properly raised and the same is not investigated, it is fatal to the case of the Prosecution vide NWAFOR vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR-40684 (CA) at 20-21, IREGU vs. THE STATE (2013) 12 NWLR (PT 1367) 92 at 1/8 – 130 [sic] and ODU vs. THE STATE (2000) 7 NWLR (PT 664) 283. It was opined that the Appellant raised his alibi promptly and



5

properly and that the failure of the prosecution to investigate and disprove the same ought to lead to an acquittal. The cases of AZEEZ vs. THE STATE (2005) 8 NWLR (PT 927) 312, OZAKI vs. THE STATE (1990) ALL NLR 94, EFFIONG vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR-25750 (CA) at 15-16 and OMORUYI vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR-40133 (CA) at 56 were relied upon.

It was stated that the Prosecution failed to tender the extra judicial statements made by the Appellant and did not call any of the Police Officers that investigated the case to testify, which amounted to withholding evidence since their evidence would have been against the Prosecution if they were called. It was further stated that the ensuing doubt ought to be resolved in favour of the Appellant. The cases of BOZIN vs. THE STATE (1985) 2 NWLR (PT 8) 465 and EKAIDEM vs. THE STATE (2011) LPELR-4076 (CA) at 37-38 were referred to. It was maintained that the lower Court based its decision on the defence of alibi on speculation and not on the evidence before it. It was asserted that a Court is not to engage in speculation or conjecture. The case of ADISA vs. THE STATE (1991) 1 NWLR (PT 168) 490 was cited in support.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT’S COUNSEL
The Respondent concedes the Appellant’s submissions on the duty on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt by establishing all the essential elements of the offence charged. It was submitted that for inconsistency in the evidence of witnesses to affect the case of the Prosecution, it has to be fundamental, material, and substantial and such that occasioned a miscarriage of justice, which the Appellant had failed to show. The case of ADONIKE vs. THE STATE (supra) was called in aid. It was maintained that the Prosecution met the prerequisites for securing conviction for the offence charged.
​
In argument of the second issue, the Respondent submits that a Court is not to speculate on available defences, but that in homicide cases, the Court is to consider and deal with any defence disclosed by the evidence. It was stated that the defence of alibi does not avail the Appellant as the conditions for it to be availing are not present as the Appellant did not raise the alibi at the earliest opportunity or call those that he said that he was with vide HASSAN vs. THE STATE (2001) 6 NWLR (PT


7

709) 286 at 305 and ONYEGBU vs. THE STATE (1995) 4 SCNJ 275 at 285-286. It was asserted that the Prosecution evidence placed the Appellant at the scene of crime and therefore any alibi raised would collapse. The cases of NJOVENS vs. THE STATE (1973) 5 SC 17 and OBIDIKE vs. THE STATE (2014) LPELR-22590 at 48 were referred to.

Still in argument, the Respondent submitted that failure to call a particular witness is not withholding evidence and so not calling the Investigating Police Officer or tendering the Appellant’s extra judicial statement was not fatal since they were not material and vital to the case of the Prosecution. It was stated that nothing stopped the Appellant from tendering the extra judicial statements if he wanted. It was maintained that the Prosecution only has to call sufficient evidence to prove its case and not to call all available evidence. Section 200 of the Evidence Act and the cases of ADAJE vs. THE STATE (1979) 6-9 SC 18, JAMMAL vs. THE STATE (1999) 12 NWLR (PT 632) 582 and 597 and ALI vs. THE STATE (1988) 1 SCNJ 17 were relied upon. It was conclusively submitted that the failure to tender the murder weapon does not



8

preclude the trial Court from convicting when as in this case the evidence is cogent, convincing, and compelling enough to ground a conviction. The cases of OLAYINKA vs. THE STATE (2008) 6 ACLR 194 at 198 ratio 4 and JUA vs. THE STATE (2008) ALL FWLR (PT 440) 766 at 775 were referred to.

RESOLUTION
I have already set out the salient facts of this matter which spawned the charge against the Appellant. It is hornbook law and agreed on all sides that in criminal trials, the onus is on the Prosecution to prove the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all shadow of doubt and if the evidence is strong against a man, as to leave only a remote probability in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence: “of course it is possible, but not in the least probable”, then the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. See MILLER vs. MINISTER OF PENSIONS (1947) 2 ALL E.R. 372, MICHAEL vs. THE STATE (2008) LPELR (1874) 1 at 24 and BAKARE vs. THE STATE (1987) 3 SC 1 or (1987) LPELR (714) 1 at 12-13.
​Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean or import beyond any degree of certainty.



9

The term strictly means that within the bounds of the evidence adduced before the Court, no Tribunal of justice would convict on it having regard to the nature of the evidence led in the case. It should be a proof that excludes all reasonable inference or assumption except that which it seeks to support. It must have clarity of proof that is readily consistent with the guilt of the accused person. See THE STATE vs. ONYEUKWU (2004) 14 NWLR (PT 893) 340 at 379-380 and ONIANWA vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR (24517) 1 at 40-41. Proof beyond reasonable doubt means proof of an offence with the certainty required in a criminal trial. That certainty is that the offence was committed, which is established by proving the essential ingredients of the offence, and that it is the accused person that committed the offence.

It is settled law that there are three ways or methods of proving the guilt of an accused person, namely:
1. By reliance on a confessional statement of an accused person voluntarily made.
2. By circumstantial evidence.
3. By evidence of eyewitnesses.
See EMEKA vs. THE STATE (2001) 32 WRN 37 at 49, OKUDO vs. THE STATE (2011) 8 NWLR (PT



10

1234) 209 at 236, ADEYEMO vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR (24688) 1 at 16 and OGOGOVIE vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR (40501) 1 at 11, which also seemed to have added a fourth way or method, id est, “admission by conduct of the accused person/appellant.” (per Odili, JSC).
​
The Prosecution called only two witnesses and it did not tender any exhibits. There was no evidence led of the investigation conducted into the case and the extra judicial statement of the Appellant, which even though part of the proof of evidence, was not tendered in evidence. There has been quite some sparring by the parties on whether there was withholding of evidence and if it is fatal that the Investigating Police Officers did not testify and that the extra judicial statements of the Appellant were not tendered in evidence. The lower Court held that the offence charged was proved beyond reasonable doubt placing premium on the eyewitness testimony of the PW2, which the Appellant has contended is contradictory. We will find out in a trice if there is contradiction in the testimony of the PW2 and if the contradiction is such that is material to make her testimony unreliable.


11


But first, it seems to me settled law that there is no obligation on the Prosecution to call a host of witnesses, provided that the material witnesses are called. What really matters is not the number of witnesses called, but the quality of evidence adduced: SUNDAY vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (42259) 1 at 25-26, OLAYINKA vs. THE STATE (2007) 9 NWLR (PT 1040) 561 at 576 and 584, ADEDARA vs. THE STATE (2009) LPELR (8194) 1 at 76 and AKINYEMI vs. THE STATE (1998) 6 NWLR (PT 607) 449 at 466. The test of the testimonial value in determining whether the quality of evidence meets the required degree of proof are credibility, intelligence, freedom from bias or prejudices, opportunity to be informed, disposition to tell the truth or otherwise and probability or improbability of the evidence being true. In aliis verbis, the credibility of evidence does not ordinarily depend on the number of witnesses that testify on a particular point. The crucial question is whether the evidence of one credible witness, on a particular point, is believed and accepted. If it is, like the lower Court believed and accepted the testimony of the PW2, then it is sufficient to justify a



12

conviction. See generally ALI vs. THE STATE (1988) 1 NWLR (PT 68) 1, GIRA vs. THE STATE (1996) 4 NWLR (PT 443) 375 at 382, MUHAMMAD vs. THE STATE (2020) LPELR (50867) 1 at 37 and DABO vs. THE STATE (2022) LPELR (58866) 1 at 11-12.

The Appellant has faulted the decision of the lower Court that the defence of alibi was not availing, the lower Court having held that the defence of alibi was raised for the first time in Court and that the evidence of the Prosecution fixed the Appellant at the locus criminis (see pages 71-72 of the Records of Appeal). Paucis verbis, alibi means elsewhere other than the scene of crime at the relevant time: ATTAH vs. THE STATE (2010) 10 NWLR (PT 1201) 190. In criminal trials, where the defence of alibi is raised at the earliest opportunity, the Prosecution has the burden to investigate it and disprove the same. It is not for the accused person to establish his alibi to the satisfaction of the Court; it is for the Prosecution to disprove the alibi vide OSUAGWU vs. THE STATE (2013) LPELR (19823) 1 at 20-21. Howbeit, the defence of alibi is destroyed by contrary evidence fixing the accused person at the scene of crime. See 



13

KOLADE vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (42362) 1 at 35-36, OSUAGWU vs. THE STATE (supra) at 21, ONUCHUKWU vs. THE STATE (1998) LPELR (2701) 1 at 21 and PETER vs. THE STATE (1997) LPELR (2913) 1 at 29-30.
In NJOVENS vs. THE STATE (1973) LPELR (2042) 1 at 52-53, Coker, JSC stated:
"There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could not have been at the scene of the crime and only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the alibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible and/or invariable way of doing this. If the prosecution adduce sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the person at the scene of crime at the material time, surely his alibi is thereby logically and physically demolished. The Supreme Court had had the occasion to consider this point in Hemyo Atam and Anor v. The State, SC. 632/66 decided on the 11th January, 1967 and had observed on this point as follows:
‘Each of the appellants made a statement under caution after his arrest, setting up an alibi. The police officer



14

who took the statements was asked whether he had done anything to check their truth and said that he had not and it was submitted that for this reason justice had been denied to the appellants and there should at least have been a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. There are occasions on which a failure to check an alibi may cast doubt on the reliability of the case for the prosecution, but in a case such as this where the appellants were identified by three eyewitnesses there was a straight issue of credibility and we are not able to say that the judge's findings of fact were unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. If the alibis had been true, it would have been open to the appellants to call witnesses in support of them and neither of them did so.’”
See also OLATINWO vs. THE STATE (2013) LPELR (19979) 1 at 19-20 and AGU vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (41664) 1 at 29.
​It is agreed on all sides that alibi must be raised at the earliest opportunity for the same to be investigated. The Appellant has also rightly submitted that a Court is not to engage in speculation or conjecture. The earliest opportunity for the



15

Appellant to raise his alibi would be in his extra judicial statement. The said extra judicial statement was not tendered in evidence and there was nothing stopping the Appellant from calling the Investigating Police Officer and tendering the same in evidence, the Prosecution having failed to tender the same; if he considered the same material to his defence: OCHIBA vs. THE STATE (2011) 17 NWLR (PT 1277) 663 at 695 and OKOROJI vs. THE STATE (2002) 5 NWLR (PT 759) 21. Since the extra judicial statement is not in evidence, the argument that the defence of alibi was raised at the earliest opportunity would be inviting the Court to speculate on whether alibi was raised in the extra judicial statement which is not in evidence. The evidence on record in the testimony of the defence witnesses discloses that the defence of alibi was raised at the trial. There is therefore no basis to fault the holding of the lower Court in this regard.
​
The Appellant has made a kerfuffle that the testimony of the PW2 is contradictory. The Appellant has anchored his contention on the fact that the PW2 testified that the deceased was killed by unknown people and later said that she



16

knows those that killed the deceased, identifying the Appellant as one of them. (See page 19 of the Records of Appeal). I have taken time to review the testimony of the PW2 and after a holistic and integral consideration of the evidence, I am unable to agree that there is any contradiction in the identification of the Appellant by the PW2 as one of the persons that killed the deceased. The PW2 identified the Appellant by his moniker and physically identified him in Court as the culprit. The PW2 remained unshaken under cross examination and went further to testify as to what was used in dealing the fatal blow on the deceased as well as describing the clothes that the Appellant wore on the day of the incident. The PW2 was adamant and explicit under cross examination that she witnessed the Appellant kill the deceased and that “she saw them with my eye when they hit and killed Hauwa (deceased) with a hoe.” In light of the foregoing, there can be no doubt arising from the testimony of the PW2 which could have been resolved in favour of the Appellant.
​
For contradiction in the evidence of the Prosecution to affect a conviction, the contradiction



17

must be such that raises doubts as to the guilt of the accused person. See IGBI vs. THE STATE (2000) 3 NWLR (PT 648) 169 at 187 and 188, ISIBOR vs. THE STATE (2002) LPELR-1553 1 at 8-9 and UKPONG vs. THE STATE (2019) LPELR (46427) 1 at 25-26. I restate that there is nothing in the alleged contradiction latched on to by the Appellant which is material and substantial to the extent that it cast serious doubt on the testimony of the PW2 as a whole or on her positive identification of the Appellant as the assailant. The Appellant is therefore not entitled to a decision setting aside the judgment of the lower Court based on the alleged contradiction: IKPA vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (42590) 1 at 45-48, OCHEMAJE vs. THE STATE (2008) 15 NWLR (PT 1109) 57 at 79-80 and 88-89, UKPONG vs. THE STATE (supra) and ETIM vs. THE STATE (2020) LPELR (51058) 1 at 38-43.

The Appellant was convicted for the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death. The learned Counsel has set out the essential ingredients to establish in the said charge. These are:
1. That the deceased is dead.
2. That the death of the deceased is the result of the act or omission of the



18

accused person (the Appellant herein).
3. That the act or omission of the accused person (Appellant) which has caused the death of the deceased is intentional with full knowledge that death or grievous bodily harm is the probable consequence.
See ILODIGWE vs. THE STATE (2012) LPELR (9342) 1, UWAGBOE vs. THE STATE (2008) LPELR (3444) 1 at 29 and OGEDENGBE vs. THE STATE (2014) LPELR (23065) 1 at 45-46. To secure a conviction for culpable homicide punishable with death, the Prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased was caused directly or indirectly by the act of the accused person. The Prosecution has to establish not only that the act of the accused person caused the death of the deceased but that in fact, the deceased died as a result of the act of the accused person to the exclusion of all other possibilities. The lower Court after due evaluation of the evidence held that all these ingredients were established. (See pages 70-72 of the Records of Appeal). The evidence established that the deceased is dead, and this has not been confuted in this appeal. The eyewitness testimony of the PW2 established that it was the



19

act of the Appellant hitting the deceased on the head with a hoe that resulted in her death. The act of hitting the deceased on the head, a delicate part of the body makes it evident that the Appellant intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm in the full knowledge that death or grievous bodily harm is the probable consequence. The eyewitness testimony of the PW2 firmly fixed the Appellant at the scene of crime, such that the Appellant’s alibi raised at the trial crumbled and fell like a pack of cards: KOLADE vs. THE STATE (supra) at 35-36, OSUAGWU vs. THE STATE (supra) at 21, ONUCHUKWU vs. THE STATE (supra) at 21 and PETER vs. THE STATE (supra) at 29-30.

It is trite law that a person intends the natural consequences of his action and where there is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm and death results, then the accused person must be held culpable for the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death. See NWOKEARU vs. THE STATE (2013) LPELR (20642) 1 at 36. To determine whether a defendant really had an intention to kill, the criteria which have been laid down by law include:
1. The nature of the weapon used, which has to be



20

a lethal weapon in the sense that it is a weapon which can be deadly or cause death;
2. The part of the body, which was brutalized by the lethal weapon, and;
3. The extent of proximity of the victim with the lethal weapon used by the accused person.
See also IDEN vs. THE STATE (1994) 8 NWLR (PT 365) 719. In ONYE vs. THE STATE (1994) 10 SC 81 the apex Court held that everyman is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his deliberate act and that a knife is an instrument which when used as the appellant used it in the said case can cause death or grievous bodily harm. Equally, in NWOKEARU vs. THE STATE (supra) the appellant stabbed the deceased in the stomach with a knife and the Supreme Court held that it showed an intention by the appellant to cause grievous harm to the deceased. Also, in EJEKA vs. THE STATE (2003) 7 NWLR (PT 819) 408 where the appellant stabbed the deceased with a jack knife in the heart, the apex Court held that it manifested the appellant’s intention to cause grievous injury to the deceased. I iterate that in this case, the Appellant, hitting and brutalizing the deceased on the head with the hoe, manifests the



21

intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm. The fact that the hoe was not tendered in evidence and that there was no medical evidence of the cause of death is of no moment. The evidence is that the deceased died at the farm where she was attacked by the Appellant with the hoe. It is settled law that where a person who is attacked dies on the spot or shortly afterwards, it is reasonable to infer that the injury inflicted on him from the attack caused the death. See EDOHO vs. THE STATE (2010) LPELR (1015) 1 at 18-19, AUDU vs. THE STATE (2003) 7 NWLR (PT 820) 516, SHANDE vs. THE STATE (2005) 1 NWLR (PT 907) 218 and ADAVA vs THE STATE (2006) 9 NWLR (PT 984) 155.

In law, there are circumstances where medical evidence as to the cause of death can be dispensed with. The evidence is that the deceased died almost instantaneously following the attack on her with the hoe. I reiterate that where a person dies on the spot following an attack, the cause of death can be properly inferred to be from the attack. Put differently, where the cause of death is obvious, medical evidence ceases to be of any practical or legal necessity. This is especially so when, as



22

disclosed by the evidence in this matter, death was instantaneous or nearly so, following the attack. See BAKURI vs. THE STATE (1965) NMLR 163 at 164, BEN vs. THE STATE (2006) LPELR (770) 1 at 12-13, IGABELE vs. THE STATE (2006) 6 NWLR (PT 975) 100, JIBRIN vs. THE STATE (2021) LPELR (56233) 1 at 34-35 and JIBRIN vs. KANO STATE (2023) LPELR (60433) 1 at 45-47. It is therefore not fatal, and indeed of no legal consequence that no medical evidence of cause of death was led. In a coda, the lower Court correctly held that all the ingredients of the offence of culpable homicide punishable with death were proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The concatenation and conflating of the foregoing are that the two issues distilled for determination must perforce be resolved against the Appellant. The appeal is bereft of any merit whatsoever, it fails, and it is hereby dismissed. The decision of the lower Court convicting the Appellant is hereby affirmed.
​
ALI ABUBAKAR BABANDI GUMEL, J.C.A.: My learned brother Ogakwu, JCA, afforded me the opportunity of a preview of his leading judgment in this appeal. After reading the processes in the printed record of appeal,



23

including the judgment of the lower Court, as well as the briefs of argument of the respective parties, it is irresistible to disagree with my learned brother that this appeal is totally devoid of any merit. My learned brother opted to let sleeping dogs to continue their deep slumber and left them undisturbed. I agree with him.

After a total view of the facts and evidence adduced at the trial of the Appellant, I am of the considered opinion that he was properly found guilty as charged.

MOHAMMED DANJUMA, J.C.A.: I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the lead judgment of my learned brother UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, J.C.A. I agree with the reasoning and conclusion that this appeal is bereft of merit, and is hereby dismissed.
​
I abide by all the consequential order(s) in the lead judgment.

UGOCHUKWU ANTHONY OGAKWU, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): The Appellant and one other were arraigned before the High Court of Yobe State on a three Count Charge of Conspiracy, Armed Robbery and Receiving Stolen Property in CHARGE NO. YBS/DT/HC/08C/2021. They were charged together in Count One for conspiracy, while the Appellant was charged alone in Count Three for receiving stolen property and his co-accused was charged alone in Count Two for armed robbery. At the end of the trial, the lower Court discharged the Appellant on Count One for conspiracy but convicted him on Count Three for receiving stolen property and sentenced him to ten years imprisonment. The Appellant by this appeal ventilates his dissatisfaction with the decision of the lower Court.

​It is pertinent to state at this outset that the Appellant’s co-accused was convicted by the lower Court on the counts of conspiracy and armed robbery. He was dissatisfied with the judgment of the lower Court, and he appealed against the same in APPEAL NO. CA/G/124C/2022: USMAN BULAMA ARI vs. THE STATE. The said appeal was successful and this Court in its judgment which was delivered on


1

29th March, 2023 set aside the decision of the lower Court and discharged and acquitted the Appellant therein on both counts of conspiracy and armed robbery for which the lower Court convicted him. The said judgment of this Court is reported as USMAN BULAMA ARI vs. THE STATE (2023) LPELR-60140 (CA). We will find out in the course of this judgment, the effect, if any, the previous decision of this Court will have on the instant appeal wherein the Appellant challenges his conviction for receiving stolen property vis-a-vis the decision discharging and acquitting the co-accused on the count of armed robbery.
​
The judgment of the lower Court which was delivered on 2nd March, 2022 is at pages 59-82 of the Records of Appeal, while the original Notice of Appeal filed on 20th April, 2022 is at pages 85-89 of the Records of Appeal. However, the extant Notice of Appeal on which the appeal was argued is the Amended Notice of Appeal filed on 5th March, 2024, but deemed as properly filed on 11th March, 2024. In prosecution of the appeal, the Records of Appeal having been compiled and transmitted, the parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument, which learned counsel


2

adopted and relied upon at the hearing of the appeal. The extant Appellant’s brief is the Appellant’s Amended Brief of Argument filed on 5th March, 2024 but deemed as properly filed on 11th March, 2024, wherein three issues were distilled for determination as follows:
“ISSUE ONE
Whether the heavy reliance placed on Exhibit B by the trial Court in convicting the Appellant inspite [sic] the woeful failure of the prosecution to satisfy the procedural and evidential requirements in the making and reception of same by the Court in evidence did not occasion grave miscarriage of Justice on Appellant? (Distilled from ground 1)
ISSUE TWO
Whether having regards to the evidence on record, the prosecution in this case proved the essential ingredients of the offence under S.5 of the Robbery and Firearms Act, more so in view of the irreconcilable contradictions manifest in the evidence of prosecution witnesses? (Distilled from grounds 2 and 3).
ISSUE THREE
Whether the trial Court evaluated or properly evaluated the evidence proffered at the trial by parties and adverted its mind to the defence of Alibi Canvassed by Appellant



3

before convicting him? (distilled from grounds 4, 5 and 6 of the Notice of Appeal).”

The Respondent in its Respondent’s Amended Brief of Argument filed on 11th March, 2024 adopted the three issues formulated by the Appellant and proffered its submissions thereon. I will presently review the submissions of learned counsel and then resolve the appeal synchronously.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT’S COUNSEL
The conspectus of the Appellant’s submission on his issue number one is that the lower Court convicted principally on the Appellant’s extra-judicial statement, Exhibit B, as the Prosecution witnesses failed to satisfy the Court as to the complicity of the Appellant. It was stated that the lower Court was wrong to accord probative value to the said Exhibit B, given the procedural errors in its making and reception of the same in evidence. It was opined that the PW1 did not state in what language he recorded Exhibit B, and in what language he explained the contents thereof to the Appellant. It was posited that no vernacular version of Exhibit B was tendered in evidence and the PW1 did not testify that he cautioned the



4

Appellant before taking and recording Exhibit B. The cases of ASUQUO vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR-40597 SC, ZAKWAKWA vs. QUEEN (1960) SCNIR 36 at 37-38, YAHAYA vs. DANKWAMBO (2016) 7 NWLR (PT 1511) 258 at 317, FRN vs. USMAN (2012) LPELR-7818 (SC) and USMAN vs. THE STATE (2022) 12 NWLR (PT 1843) 181 at 202-203 were referred to. The Appellant maintained that Exhibit B ought not to have been admitted in evidence at all, nor any probative value placed on it. It was further stated that the lower Court did not apply the veracity test to ascertain the truth of Exhibit B, before accepting the same. Furthermore, that the stipulations of Section 37 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Yobe State, 2020 on the procedure for recording extra-judicial statements were not complied with, thus rendering Exhibit B inadmissible. The cases of AFOLABI vs. THE STATE (2013) 6-7 MJSC (PT 1) 1 at 21-22, DAWA vs. THE STATE (1980) 8-11 SC 236, NNAJIOFOR vs. FRN (2018) LCN/11086 CA and ZHIYA vs. PEOPLE OF LAGOS STATE (2016) LPELR-40562 (CA) were relied upon.

The Appellant’s argument on his second issue is that the Prosecution has the onus of proving all the



5

ingredients of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt vide AREH vs. COP (1959) WRNLR 230 at 231, OGUNDIYAN vs. THE STATE (1991) 3 NWLR (PT 181) 519, ABDULLAHI vs. THE STATE (2008) 17 NWLR (PT 1115) 203 among others. The ingredients of the offence of receiving stolen property which must co-exist were referred to and it was submitted that the said ingredients were not proved. The cases of YONGO vs. COP (1992) NWLR [no volume stated] (PT 257) 36, THE STATE vs. NNOLIM (1994) 5 NWLR (PT 345) 394, JOHN vs. THE STATE (2013) LPELR-22197 (CA) and ZACHEOUS vs. PEOPLE OF LAGOS STATE (2015) LPELR-24531 (CA) were cited in support.
​
In argument of his third issue, the Appellant submits that the lower Court did not properly evaluate the evidence, which if it had properly done it would have adverted its mind to the Appellant’s defence of alibi. It was asserted that consequently the conclusions of the lower Court were faulty, and this Court was urged to interfere with the findings of facts made by the lower Court and to resolve any doubts in favour of the Appellant. The cases of YANOR vs. THE STATE (1965) NWLR [sic] 337 and UMANI vs. THE STATE (1998) 1 NWLR (PT. 70)



6

274 were called in aid.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT’S COUNSEL
On the first issue, the Respondent submits that the Appellant’s extra-judicial statement, Exhibit B, was admitted in evidence without objection and that the contention now raised on appeal on non-compliance with Section 37 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law was an afterthought. It was stated that a confession is the strongest evidence of guilt and can ground a conviction without any corroborative evidence, once the confession is direct, positive, and properly proved. The cases of ALARAPE vs. THE STATE (2001) FWLR (PT. 41) 1872, ADAMU vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR-40326 (CA) at 24, BASIL vs. THE STATE (2018) 163 LRCN 186 at 192, EMOGA vs. THE STATE (1997) 7 SCNJ 518 at 529 and BAALO vs. FRN (2016) LPELR-40500 (SC) at 26 were referred to. It was asserted that Exhibit B was properly admitted in evidence and that the lower Court rightly relied on the same to arrive at its decision.
​
On the second issue, the Respondent maintains that it proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. The ingredients of the offence of receiving stolen property subject of armed robbery were



7

referred to and the cases of OJO vs. THE STATE (2018) LPELR-44699 (SC) at 24, THE STATE vs. BELLO (1989) 1 CLRN 370, BOZIN vs. THE STATE (1985) 7 SC (Reprint) [no page stated] and BALOGUN vs. A-G OGUN STATE (2001) FWLR (PT 780) 1144 were relied upon.

The three ways of proving the commission of an offence vide EMEKA vs. THE STATE (2001) 14 NWLR (PT 734) 666 at 669 ratio 1 were referred to and it was submitted that the Prosecution proved all the ingredients of the offence through the testimony of its witnesses and the exhibits tendered, including the Appellant’s confessional statement, Exhibit B. It was opined that the law only requires the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and not beyond all shadow of doubt. The cases of UGO vs. C. O. P (1972) 11 SC 37, AMEH vs. THE STATE (1973) 6-7 SC at 27 and JUA vs. THE STATE (2010) 43 WRN 1 at 24-25 were called in aid.

The quiddity of the Respondent’s submission on issue number three is that evaluation of evidence is the primary duty of the trial Court and that an appellate Court will not interfere except where the trial Court had failed in its duty. The cases of ALI vs. LIKITA



8

(2013) LPELR-22814 (CA) at 19-20, SHA vs. KWAN (2000) 5 SC 178, OJOKOLOBO vs. ALAMU (1998) 9 NWLR (PT. 565) 226, FAGBENRO vs. AROBADI (2006) 7 NWLR (PT. 978) 174 and THE STATE vs. AGIE (2000) 7 SC (PT. 1) 24 were cited in support. It was maintained that the lower Court properly evaluated the evidence before it reached its decision and so there was no basis for the appellate Court to interfere.

RESOLUTION
To conduce to the utmost pellucidity, I will redact the salient background facts of this matter. The Appellant was one of two accused persons jointly tried by the lower Court. In its judgment, the lower Court convicted the Appellant’s co-accused, inter alia, for armed robbery and convicted the Appellant for the offence of receiving the property stolen from the robbery for which the co-accused was convicted. As earlier stated, the Appellant’s co-accused was successful in his appeal against his conviction and this Court set aside the decision of the lower Court convicting him for armed robbery.

Now, the parties are ad idem on the onus on the Prosecution to prove the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. The only divergence is on the



9

extremes they have taken on whether the burden was discharged. Our criminal justice system is accusatorial. This is in tune with Section 36 (5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), which provides that a person charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. The necessary corollary of the presumption of innocence is that the Prosecution has the onus of proving the commission of the offences charged beyond reasonable doubt as stipulated in Section 135 of the Evidence Act, 2011. If on the whole of the evidence adduced a state of doubt exists, then the Prosecution would have failed to discharge the onus of proof and the accused person will be entitled to an acquittal: UKPE vs. THE STATE (2001) 18 WRN 84 at 105. Howbeit, proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all shadow of doubt and where the evidence adduced is strong as to leave only a remote probability in favour of the accused person, then the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. See BAKARE vs. THE STATE (1987) 3 S.C. 1 or (1987) LPELR (714) 1 at 12-13. The burden on the Prosecution of proving a charge beyond



10

reasonable doubt does not mean or import beyond any degree of certainty. Proof beyond reasonable doubt should be a proof that excludes all reasonable inference or assumption except that which it seeks to support. It must have clarity of proof that is readily consistent with the guilt of the accused person. See THE STATE vs. ONYEUKWU (2004) 14 NWLR (PT 893) 340 at 379-380. Proof beyond reasonable doubt means proof of an offence with the certainty required in a criminal trial. That certainty is that the offence was committed, which is established by proving the essential ingredients of the offence, and that it is the person charged therewith that committed the offence. Therefore, the pertinent inquisition in this appeal is whether the lower Court rightly held that the offence of receiving stolen property against the Appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt.
​
It is abecedarian law that there are three ways or methods of proving the guilt of an accused person, namely:
1. By reliance on a confessional statement of an accused person voluntarily made.
2. By circumstantial evidence.
3. By evidence of eyewitnesses.
See EMEKA vs. THE STATE



11

(2001) 32 WRN 37 at 49, OKUDO vs. THE STATE (2010) 8 NWLR (PT. 1234) 209 at 236, OLAOYE vs. THE STATE (2018) LPELR (43601) 1 at 13, ADEYEMO vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR (24688) 1 at 16 and OGOGOVIE vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR (40501) 1 at 11, which also seemed to have added a fourth way or method, id est, “admission by conduct of the accused person/appellant.” (per Odili, JSC).

It is effulgent from the cold printed Records that the lower Court primarily and principally based its conviction of the Appellant on the Appellant’s extra-judicial statement, Exhibit B. Little wonder that the Appellant has mounted a fierce challenge on the admissibility and consequent probative value to be attached to the said Exhibit B. However, it seems to me that this challenge is coming a little too late in the day. The Appellant’s extra-judicial statement, Exhibit B, was tendered through the PW1. It is translucent from pages 18-19 of the Records of Appeal that the said Exhibit B was tendered and admitted in evidence without any objection. It is hornbook law that when a confessional statement is admitted without objection from the maker or his Counsel, the



12

law implies that the maker of the statement agrees with everything in the statement. It also means that the maker made the statement voluntarily and that it is the truth of his role in the crime. The appropriate time to object to a statement made by an accused person on the ground of inadmissibility as in this case, for non-compliance with the stipulations of Section 37 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Yobe State, 2020, is at the time when the Prosecution seeks to tender the statement in evidence and not at the appellate Court: SMART vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR (40827) 1 at 21, OGUDO vs. THE STATE (2011) LPELR (860) 1 at 28, OSENI vs. THE STATE (2012) LPELR (7833) 1, MUHAMMAD vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (42098) 1 at 17-18 and ROLAND vs. FRN (2018) LPELR (43686) 1 at 40-44. In TOPE vs. THE STATE (2019) LPELR (47837) 1 at 19-20, Okoro, JSC stated the legal position in the following words:
“It is trite law that in a criminal trial, where an accused person wishes to attack the voluntariness of a confessional statement, he must raise an objection to the admission of that statement at the point where it is sought to be tendered. Where



13

he fails to object to the admissibility of the statement when it is sought to be tendered, it will be taken that he conceded that he made the statement voluntarily and the content thereof represents what he told the recorder of the statement … In this case, the Appellant failed to object to the admission of Exhibit A and C at the point when they were tendered by the prosecution. He cannot thereafter successfully urge an appellate Court to discountenance those statements which were rightly admitted and relied on by the trial Court.”
See also GODSGIFT vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR (40540) 1 at 31, ALO vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR (24404) 1 at 25-26 and FRN vs. IWEKA (2011) LPELR (9350) 1 at 29. Accordingly, on the settled state of the law, the Appellant raising issues on compliance vel non with Section 37 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Yobe State and the language in which the statement was volunteered and interpreted, which he failed to do when the statement was sought to be tendered in evidence at the trial, is dead on arrival. The horse has already bolted, closing the stable door thereafter is ineffectual and ineffective!




14

I iterate that the lower Court relied heavily on Exhibit B to convict the Appellant. Without a doubt, it is rudimentary law that a confessional statement made by an accused person is potent evidence in the hand of a Prosecutor for proving a charge. It is the best and safest evidence on which to convict. See ADEBAYO vs. A-G OGUN STATE (2008) 7 NWLR (PT 1085) 201 at 221, USMAN vs. THE STATE (2011) 3 NWLR (PT 1233) 1 at 11 and OSENI vs. THE STATE (2012) 5 NWLR (PT 1293) 351 at 387. A confessional statement in criminal law is a statement which admits of the crime. It is evident from the Records of Appeal that the Appellant in his testimony in defence told a story entirely different from the contents of Exhibit B, thereby retracting and resiling from the same. Regardless, the wisdom of the law is that retracting or resiling from the statement does not render the same inadmissible and the Court can still convict on the statement. See ALARAPE vs. THE STATE (2001) 14 WRN 1 at 20, KAREEM vs. FRN (2001) 49 WRN 97 at 111, EHOT vs. THE STATE (1993) 5 SCNJ 65, EGBOGHONOME vs. THE STATE (1993) 7 NWLR (PT. 306) 385 at 431, OBISI vs. CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF (2002) 19 WRN 26 at


15

38-39 and HASSAN vs. THE STATE (2001) 7 SC (PT II) 85 at 93. However, in such circumstances, the law is that a Court cannot act on the confessional statement without first applying the test for determining the veracity or otherwise of the confessional statement. The law enjoins the Court to seek any other evidence however slight, or circumstances which make it probable that the confession is true. The tests laid down in the case of R. vs. SYKES (1913) 1 Cr. App. R 233 has been applied in numerous cases including NWAEBONYI vs. THE STATE (1994) 5 NWLR (PT 343) 138, AKINMOJU vs. THE STATE (2004) 4 SC (PT I) 64 at 81, UBIERHO vs. THE STATE (2005) 7 MJSC 168 at 188-189, ALARAPE vs. THE STATE (2001) 14 WRN 1 at 20 and OSENI vs. THE STATE (supra) at 387 to mention a few. The tests which have been laid down to ascertain the weight to be attached to a confessional statement is one that places a duty on the Court to examine the statement in the light of other credible evidence before the Court by inquiring into whether:
1. There is anything outside the confession to show that it is true.
2. It is corroborated.
3. The facts stated in the confession are



16

true as far as can be tested.
4. The accused person had the opportunity of committing the offence.
5. The accused person’s confession is possible.
6. The confession is consistent with the other facts ascertained and proved.

Now, how did the lower Court approach the issue of utilising the retracted Exhibit B to convict? Hear the lower Court at pages 78-79 of the Records of Appeal:
“Similarly, the 2nd accused also admitted in his prejudicial statement Exhibit ‘B’ that the safe box was taken to his house and when it was dismantled some money was found therein and divided same with Mu’azu, Gundelli and the 2nd accused, where he was given N50,000 as his share, but in his testimony in his defence before this Court denied it completely. I agree with the learned prosecution counsel’s submission that a retraction of a confessional statement by an accused does not make it inadmissible. In Sule vs. the State (2009) 17 NWLR (part 1169) page 33 at 42 it was held that it is trite law that when an accused person makes a statement to the police and in his evidence in chief, he denies the statement, such testimony



17

is usually treated as unreliable and therefore ignored by the Court. See also the case of Okafor vs. The State (2006) 4 NWLR (part 969) page 1. I equally ignored the testimonies of the 1st and 2nd accused persons and rely on their prejudicial statements Exhibits A and B respectively as same were made by them voluntarily and neither of them or their counsel objected to their admissibility. Section 28 of the Evidence Act 2011 as amended states:
‘A confession is an admission made at any time by a person charged with a crime stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime."
I hold that the confessional statements of the accused persons as contained in exhibits ‘A’ and ‘B’ are direct, positive, unequivocal and voluntarily made by them. Neither the accused person not [sic] their counsel objected when they were sought to be tendered in evidence in the course of the trial. Therefore, I have no reason whatsoever to deviate or decline acting on them. I accept the persecution counsel’s submissions and authorities she cited and relied upon in this regard.
It is trite law that a confessional statement



18

alone is enough to warrant a conviction without any corroboration provided the Court is satisfied with the truth of the confession, even where it is inconsistent with the accused persons’ statements in Court as in the instant case.”

The lower Court then conclusively held as follows at page 81 of the Records of Appeal:
“On the 3rd count of the charge, I find the 2nd accused person Zulkiflu Adamu guilty for dishonestly receiving stolen property, subject of armed robbery and accordingly convict him under Section 5 of the Robbery and Firearms (Special provision) Act Cap RII 2004.”

It is lucent from the above pericope that the lower Court did not apply the six-way test to ascertain the veracity of Exhibit B, it rather applied the inconsistency rule to hold that the Appellant’s testimony in Court was unreliable and ignored the same. This is a wrong application of the inconsistency rule as the same does not apply to the testimony of an accused person. In SMART vs. THE STATE (supra) at 16-17, Rhodes-Vivour, JSC intoned:
​“My Lords, the inconsistency rule applies to witnesses and not to an accused person. The



19

witness is also given an opportunity while giving evidence on oath to explain the inconsistency. The rule is applied when the witness fails to explain the inconsistency. On the other hand, the inconsistency does not apply to an accused person who resiles from his extra judicial statement.” In his contribution at pages 39-45, Nweze, JSC (of blessed memory) asseverated:
"In particular, I endorse my Lord's view that ‘the inconsistency rule applies [only] to witnesses and not to an accused person’… the inconsistency rule traces its jurisprudential pedigree to England. Its most eloquent formulation can be found in R v Golder (1960) 1 WLR 1169 where Lord Parker CJ held: when a witness is shown to have made previous statements inconsistent with the evidence given by that witness at the trial, the jury should not merely be directed that the evidence given at the trial should be regarded as unreliable; they should also be directed that the previous statements, whether sworn or unsworn, do not constitute evidence upon which they can act. Well before the decision in R v Golder (supra), the rule had been applied to witnesses



20

only…. The first case to invoke that rule in Nigeria was Queen v Ukpang (1961) ALL NLR 25, 26 which approved the statement of law in R v Golder (supra). At its said evolution in Nigeria, therefore, the posture of the Courts was that the rule was, properly, applicable to the evidence of an ordinary prosecution witness. Subsequent decisions confirmed this posture… Indeed, in Udo v The Queen, (1964) ALLNLR 21, 24, Brett JSC resisted an attempt to extend the application of the rule to the previous confession of an accused person and his evidence. As noted above, on its adoption in Nigeria, the rule was applicable to the evidence of an ordinary witness… in addition to considering the totality of the evidence, the witness was given an opportunity, while in the witness box, to explain the inconsistency… The rule was limited to the statement of a witness and his inconsistent testimony. However, in 1985, the decision in Owie v The State (1985) 1 NWLR (Pt. 3) 470, for the first time, extended the rule to the statement and evidence of the accused person. Subsequent decisions… perpetuated this trend. Interestingly, in 1989, this Court



21

went back to the earlier position in Udo v The Queen, (supra) and held that the principle did not apply to an accused person and his confessional statement, Ikemson v The State (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt.110) 455, 473. Such was the uncertainty that characterized application of the rule in Nigeria … This state of affairs continued until 1993 when, in Egboghonome v The State (supra), this Court streamlined the application of the rule... Consistent with the doctrine of stare decisis, post Egboghonome decisions have reverted to the position in Udo v The Queen (supra), namely, that the inconsistency rule does not apply to the previous confessions of an accused person and his evidence in Court…” See also SULE vs. THE STATE (2009) 17 NWLR (PT. 1169) 33 at 60-61, SIMON vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (41988) 1 at 17-19, AYINDE vs. THE STATE (2018) LPELR (44761) 1 at 49-50 and THE STATE vs. ALIYU (2022) LPELR (59477) 1 at 10-12. On the settled state of the law, it cannot be confuted that the lower Court was wrong in its application of the inconsistency rule, and equally wrong when it proceeded to convict on the retracted confessional statement without



22

subjecting the same to the veracity test.

The learned counsel on both sides of the divide have referred to the ingredients of the offence of receiving stolen property, which ingredients must all be established for the offence to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. These ingredients are:
1. That the property in question is stolen property.
2. That the accused person received or retained such property.
3. That he did so dishonestly.
4. That he knew or had reason to believe that the property was stolen property.
See YONGO vs. C. O. P. (1992) LPELR (3528) 1 at 36, THE STATE vs. NNOLIM (1994) LPELR (3222) 1 at 21-22 and OGUNGBAIYE vs. FRN (2022) LPELR (57269) 1 at 8-9.

It must be remembered that the case of the Prosecution is that it is the property stolen by the Appellant’s co-accused during the alleged robbery incident that the Appellant received, knowing that it was stolen. This Court, in the judgment I referred to at the outset, reported as USMAN BULAMA ARI vs. THE STATE (2023) LPELR-60140 (CA), discharged and acquitted the Appellant’s co-accused on the count of armed robbery. The concomitance is that the count of



23

robbery against the co-accused having failed, the Appellant herein could not have received any stolen property since the subsisting decision of the Court is that there was no robbery proved. The snowball effect of this will be that the first ingredient that the property in question is stolen property has not been proved. This ingredient not having been established, the evidence of the Prosecution has not risen to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt of the offence charged.
​
In a criminal trial, the burden is always on the Prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt. There is no duty on the accused person to prove his innocence. However, where the evidence adduced by the Prosecution is tested, scrutinised, and accepted by a trial Court and it conclusively points to the accused person as the perpetrator of the crime charged, the evidential burden is then on the accused person to rebut the presumption that he committed the crime and at least cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case by preponderance of probabilities. See AKINMOJU vs. THE STATE (2000) 6 NWLR (PT 352) 608 at 629, IGABELE vs. THE STATE



24

(2006) 6 NWLR (PT. 975) 100 at 136-137 and KEKONG vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (42343) 1 at 28.

Au contraire, when as in this case an essential ingredient of the offence charged has not been proved flowing from a subsisting decision of this Court, then the ensuing doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused person as there will be no need for him to be seen to have cast a doubt on the Prosecution case on the balance of probabilities since the evidence adduced by the Prosecution does not meet the required standard of proof. See DIBIA vs. THE STATE (2017) LPELR (48453) 1 at 54-55, OKASHETU vs. THE STATE (2016) LPELR (40611) 1 at 34, IDEMUDIA vs. THE STATE (2015) LPELR (24835) 1 at 34 and OMOPUPA vs. THE STATE (2007) LPELR (8571) 1 at 45.

It is rudimentary law that this Court is bound by its previous decisions based on the doctrine of stare decisis: USMAN vs. UMARU (1992) LPELR (3432) 1 at 21, OKEKE vs. THE STATE (1995) 4 NWLR (PT. 392) 676 and APARI vs. HOSE (1999) LPELR (6650) 1 at 8. The previous decision of this Court I have referred to is on the same judgment of the lower Court which is complained about in this appeal. The evidence adduced against the



25

appellant in the previous appeal and the Appellant herein are in the same joint trial and evidence. That evidence has been held in the previous decision of this Court as not establishing the offence of armed robbery against the Appellant’s co-accused. By parity of reasoning or analogous reasoning, the robbery not having been proved, the Appellant cannot be convicted of receiving stolen property from a robbery that was not established by the evidence. In the diacritical circumstances, it is ineluctable that the conviction of the Appellant cannot be sustained.

It is highly prejudicial and a miscarriage of justice to allow the conviction of the Appellant by the lower Court to stand. This appeal is therefore meritorious. It is allowed by me too. I abide by all the consequential orders of my learned brother in the leading judgment.
